## What it does

`grilling` is the interview loop that stress-tests a plan, decision, or idea before anyone acts. It maps the subject as a **design tree**, classifies each open node by how it can be resolved, and interviews the current decision horizon until nothing material is silently assumed.

For game work it begins with intended player experience, the strongest creative promise, the current playable milestone, and approved source/project authority. It does not turn camera feel into a prose setting, intentional mystery into a forced answer, or a specialist mechanism into a creative decision.

## When to reach for it

Type `/grilling`, or the [agent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/agent) reaches for it on its own when a task fits. It is the only [skill](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/skill) in the grilling family that is model-invoked, which is why you rarely type it: usually a skill you *did* type is running it for you.

Typing `/grilling` directly gets you the plain interview and nothing else. Where you want something more than that:

| What you have | Reach for |
| --- | --- |
| You aren't working in a working directory | [grill-me](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-me) — the same [session](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/session), under a name the agent will never fire by itself |
| You are in a working directory | [grill-with-docs](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-with-docs) — the same session, and it writes `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs as it goes |
| An effort too big to hold in one session | [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder) — it charts a map and runs grilling inside the decision tickets |
| A question that talking cannot settle — how something should look or feel | [prototype](https://aihero.dev/skills-prototype) — build the throwaway version, then come back |
| A skill of your own that needs an interview | Invoke `/grilling` from it, rather than writing another interview |

## The round, the frontier, and who decides

Three ideas carry the whole skill.

The **design tree** is the model of the subject: decisions with decisions hanging off them. The **frontier** is the set of decisions whose prerequisites are all settled — the only questions that can honestly be asked yet. A **round** is one frontier, asked in full and answered in full.

Inside a round every question arrives in a fixed shape: numbered and titled behind a `❓`, then the body, then the agent's recommended answer alone on a `➡️` line. That is what makes a round answerable by number — "1 yes, 2 the second option, 3 no, here's why" — instead of by quoting questions back. The format has one known rough edge: the recommendation sometimes argues *against* the question as it was worded, so agreeing with the recommendation means answering "no" to the question. When that happens, answer the recommendation and say so.

The other half is resolution classification. A **decision** belongs to its named authority; a **fact** is looked up; an **experiment** needs representative observed evidence; a **specialist question** routes to its technical owner; **protected ambiguity** remains unresolved by design; and a **deferred/out-of-scope** node sits beyond this milestone. Evidence lookup can run through one accountable runtime adapter without blocking unrelated questions, but workers never answer the user's decisions or redelegate recursively.

The session ends when the current milestone's frontier is empty, not when every imaginable future branch has been designed. The closing ledger names settled decisions, evidence, experiments, specialist questions, protected ambiguity, deferrals, owners, and return paths. It still waits for your confirmation before action.

The honest limit: the frontier is the agent's judgement, not a computed graph. It can put two questions in one round and only afterwards discover that one answer should have changed the other. There is no guard against that beyond telling it, which reopens the affected branch in the next round.

## What lives here and what lives in the wrappers

This page covers the mechanism. The things people most often want are documented one level up.

## Common questions

**Can I go back to one question at a time?**
Yes, and a large part of the audience does. Add this to your global `CLAUDE.md`:

```
When grilling, ask one question at a time.
```

The round-based default is genuinely contested. Practitioners who read slowly, who work in a second language, or who use the sequential format as focus scaffolding all report the one-at-a-time rhythm is better for them, and the opt-out is supported rather than tolerated.

**Where did `/batch-grill-me` go?**
Into this skill. Round-based questioning shipped briefly as a separate skill, then moved into `grilling` itself, so everything built on the primitive — `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `triage`, `wayfinder` — got it at once. There is no `batch-grill-me` to install, and no separate sequential skill either; the `CLAUDE.md` line above is the way back to one-at-a-time.

**Asking a whole round at once must lose the questions my earlier answers would have raised. Doesn't it?**
This is the most common objection to the round design, and the frontier is the answer: a round contains decisions that do not depend on each other. Answers still reshape everything downstream—the next round is recomputed, not pre-written. Empirical and specialist nodes do not get smuggled into a round merely to keep momentum; their resolution paths block only the branches that depend on them.

**It ran out of questions and started building.**
A confirmation gate exists precisely for this: the skill is not finished when the frontier empties, it is finished when you say the understanding is shared. Weaker and faster [models](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/model) still break it — this is reported most often on lower-effort or non-frontier models, which collapse "interview until shared understanding" into a couple of questions and an outline. If yours does it, the reliable fix is a line in your own `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` telling the agent not to implement without permission.

**It answered its own questions instead of asking me.**
That is a bug in the run, not the intended behaviour, and it was the reason facts and decisions were separated in the skill's text. It shows up most when another skill runs `grilling` inside a resolve-this-ticket frame, where the surrounding task reads as licence to keep moving. The same constraint is why there is no async mode: people have asked for a variant that reads a GitHub issue and posts one consolidated decision memo, and that is a different skill, because a grilling session that nobody answers has produced the agent's opinion rather than yours.

**Can I cap the number of questions?**
No, and a cap is deliberately out of scope. Some plans need three questions and some need fifty; a fixed ceiling either truncates the hard case or feels arbitrary on the easy one. Steering in plain language is the intended control — tell it to wrap up, or stop and accept the plan where it stands. If a session is running very long, the cause is usually that the scope was too big; break the work up and grill the pieces.

**I installed `grill-me` on its own and nothing happens.**
`grill-me` is a one-line skill whose whole body is "run a `/grilling` session", so it needs this skill installed too. The same is true of `grill-with-docs`, which additionally needs [domain-modeling](https://aihero.dev/skills-domain-modeling). Installing the whole set avoids the problem; installing selectively means installing the primitives as well.

**`grill-with-docs` ran, but it never loaded `grilling`.**
A real and unfixed rough edge, reported across [harnesses](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/harness) and models: a skill that names another skill does not reliably cause that skill to load, and `grill-with-docs` names two. The tell is a session that asks everything at once with no recommendations attached — that is the model improvising an interview rather than running this one. Asking the agent directly whether it loaded `grilling` and `domain-modeling` usually recovers it.

## It's working if

- A round arrives as a numbered list, each question with its recommendation on a separate `➡️` line, and you can answer the whole round by number.
- Nothing in a round needs another question in the same round answered first.
- Later rounds ask things the first round could not have asked.
- It looks facts up rather than asking you; observed feel/runtime questions become experiments, not invented answers.
- Specialist mechanisms and source conflicts reach their correct authorities while creative trade-offs remain with you.
- Protected ambiguity and future-scope branches do not reappear as forced frontier questions.
- It stops at the milestone boundary with an owner/evidence ledger and asks you to confirm it instead of starting work.
- Question count stays high while round count stays low.

## Where it fits

`grilling` is a **primitive**, not a scheduled step: the shared interview and resolution-classification technique. [grill-me](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-me) and [grill-with-docs](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-with-docs) are its front doors; [game-development](https://aihero.dev/skills-game-development) supplies game authority, evidence, and artifact vocabulary. [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder), [triage](https://aihero.dev/skills-triage), and [improve-codebase-architecture](https://aihero.dev/skills-improve-codebase-architecture) invoke it for their bounded decisions. [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes uncertain entry points.
