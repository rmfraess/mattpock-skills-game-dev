## What it does

`domain-modeling` builds and sharpens a project's shared language while you design—challenging conflicts, qualifying terms that legitimately differ by context, mapping boundaries, and stress-testing relationships without turning hypothetical scenarios into authoritative facts.

It is the **active** discipline, not the passive one. Reading `CONTEXT.md` to borrow its vocabulary is a one-line habit any skill can do; this skill is for when you are *changing* the model. That is what makes it interrupt. It writes a resolved term into `CONTEXT.md` at the moment it is resolved, in the middle of the conversation, rather than producing a tidy glossary at the end — because the batched version is a summary of a [session](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/session), and the inline version is the session's actual output.

## When to reach for it

Type `/domain-modeling`, or the agent reaches for it automatically when a task fits. In practice, automatic invocation is the weakest part of the skill: when `grill-with-docs` or `wayfinder` say to load it, [models](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/model) frequently load `grilling` and skip this one. If a [grilling](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/grilling) session runs and `CONTEXT.md` is untouched at the end, that is what happened — invoke it by name alongside the other skill.

Reach for it when the *words* are the problem:

| The situation | The move |
| --- | --- |
| Two people mean different things by "cancellation" | `domain-modeling` — pick the canonical term, list the other under `_Avoid_` |
| "Account" is doing three jobs in three files | `domain-modeling` — split it into Customer and User |
| You just made a hard-to-reverse architectural choice | `domain-modeling` — it offers an ADR, if the choice clears the bar |
| The module's *shape* is the problem — where the seam goes, how deep the interface is | [codebase-design](https://aihero.dev/skills-codebase-design) |
| You want the whole plan interrogated before you build | [grill-with-docs](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-with-docs), which drives this skill underneath |
| You want a term looked up, not changed | Nothing. Read `CONTEXT.md`. It is a file. |

## Prerequisites

The skill first follows the project's configured language and decision-record locations. With no configured alternative, it creates these lazily:

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, created by the first resolved term. In a repo with a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root, terms go into the per-context `CONTEXT.md` the map points at instead.
- **`docs/adr/`**, created by the first ADR that clears the bar.

For game work it also reads the approved source/canon, adaptation, gameplay, engine, art, world, and production authorities. Before inline writes it checks ownership/locks; before sequential ADR creation it rechecks numbering.

## Two artifacts, two bars

The glossary and the ADR are held to different standards, and conflating them is where most of the trouble in this skill comes from.

| | `CONTEXT.md` | `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Holds | Scoped terms, concise definitions, rejected synonyms, and boundary mappings | One technical/architectural decision, in one to three sentences: context, choice, reason |
| Bar to write | A vague term became canonical | **All three**: hard to reverse, surprising without context, the result of a real trade-off |
| Written | Inline, the moment the term is settled | Offered, not assumed |
| Never holds | Implementation details, a [spec](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/spec), a scratch pad, general programming concepts | A diary of every choice made this session |

Miss any one of the ADR's three tests and there is no ADR. An easily-reversed decision will just get reversed; an unsurprising one is nobody's question; one with no real alternative records that you did the obvious thing.

The `CONTEXT.md` rule is the one to actually hold onto, because it is the one that breaks in the field. **It is a glossary and nothing else.** Left unchecked, models treat "write to `CONTEXT.md`" as permission to persist every answer you give, and the file turns into a running spec — this is the most-reported problem with the skill, across several models.

## Cross-referencing, and where it stops

The move that makes the skill click: when you state how something works, it checks the authorities that can own the claim and surfaces contradictions. That can be code, Blueprint/visual script, serialized/editor content, data/config, approved source/adaptation, player-facing intent, or observed runtime evidence. It names the scope and owner rather than treating code as the universal winner.

It still follows configured authoritative locations rather than searching every historic conversation by default. If a naming decision lives only in a closed issue or private discussion, promote it to the configured glossary/decision record or give the run an explicit pointer; otherwise later sessions cannot distinguish it from an undocumented claim.

## Common questions

**My `CONTEXT.md` is 500 lines. 1,000. 3,000. What do I do?**
The size is a symptom, not the disease — the file has absorbed implementation detail and decisions that were never glossary material. The fix is a direct instruction: `/grill-with-docs make my CONTEXT.md more concise and remove any implementation details from it`. Run it against a bloated file and most of it goes. Only reach for a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` split once the file is genuinely lean and still covers two domains that a reader would not want to hold at once; splitting a bloated file just gives you several bloated files. The skill's guidance here is not yet strong enough to prevent the growth in the first place, and the issue tracking that is still open.

**Why is it `CONTEXT.md` and not `GLOSSARY.md`?**
This is the most-argued naming question in the whole skill set and it has no settled answer. The case against the current name is good: if it is "a glossary and nothing else", `GLOSSARY.md` says so, and — as one reader put it — "with ai agents everything is [context](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/context)". The case for it is the map: `CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing at several `CONTEXT.md` files reads naturally in a way `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` does not, and `context` is the standing DDD word for a bounded area of the model. At least one person maintains a local fork purely to rename the file. You can do the same, but every other skill in the set looks for `CONTEXT.md`, so a rename means patching all of them.

**Where did `/ubiquitous-language` go?**
It was removed, and it was not deprecated. Its job moved into `domain-modeling`, which maintains the whole model continuously rather than dumping a glossary out of one conversation. Vocabulary enforcement got more load-bearing, not less — it now runs underneath grilling, triage and mapping rather than as a separate pass you remember to do.

**How do I get a glossary for a codebase that has none?**
Ask for it explicitly rather than waiting for it to accumulate. `/grill-with-docs help me scaffold my existing repo with a CONTEXT.md` is the documented route; expect a long interrogation — one user reported 50+ questions before the file was in shape. Incidental use builds the glossary far too slowly on a brownfield repo.

**Can I keep the domain model and use my own ADR format?**
Yes. Project configuration and established conventions override the fallback `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md` format. Canon, adaptation, narrative, art-direction, world, and player-experience choices go to their owning creative record rather than being forced into an ADR.

**Does a glossary actually earn its keep? It is one more artifact to review, and it can go stale.**
Sometimes it does not, and it is worth being honest about where. DDD gets less useful the closer it gets to the implementation — the payoff is upstream, in naming and concept alignment, not in aggregates and layer ceremony. Synonym control matters at naming boundaries: module names, table names, status enums, issue titles, CLI commands. It matters much less in ordinary prose. There is also a live objection that domain terms compress communication *between humans* who already share them, and that an agent responds the same way to the plain-English description — on that reading, the glossary's value is keeping you and your reviewers aligned with what the agent is doing, not making the agent better. On a one-day build, skip it. And an unreviewed, agent-authored glossary is worse than none: it becomes confident-sounding lore that later sessions treat as truth.

**Can it turn my vague prompts into domain language for me?**
No, and there is no plan for a skill that does. A domain language you do not understand yourself becomes meaningless drivel once written down. This skill enforces precision once you have the understanding — it does not manufacture vocabulary you do not have. The related trap is using domain words without doing the modelling: right nouns over the wrong conceptual structure produce output that reads correct and is not.

## It's working if

- It stops you mid-sentence to ask which of two things you meant, instead of picking one and moving on.
- `CONTEXT.md` changes **during** the conversation, not in a burst at the end.
- It refuses to write an ADR for something you could undo tomorrow — and says which of the three tests failed.
- New entries define what a thing *is* in one or two sentences and name the words you are giving up under `_Avoid_`.
- It quotes your code back at you when your code and your sentence disagree.
- It checks source, editor/serialized content, data/config, runtime evidence, and approved player-facing intent when those—not code—own the claim.
- Cross-discipline words are qualified and mapped instead of flattened, and empirical meanings stay provisional until their experiment closes.
- Two sessions cannot silently edit the same glossary or claim the same decision-record number.
- `CONTEXT.md` gets shorter as often as it gets longer.
